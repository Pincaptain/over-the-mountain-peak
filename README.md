# Over the Mountain Peak
Solution for a windows forms C# application that I used to visualize and update JSON data.
I have used this application for personal projects purely so it is not bug free.

## Usage
Add and visualize JSON data from a .json file under the strict rules of my structure.
In order to adapt this to your needs you could remove fields and add new ones, but you must
apply those changes to all the classes that utilize that data.
